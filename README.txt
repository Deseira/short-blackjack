* NOTES ****************************
************************************

Cards contain a suit, a letter, and
a value. 

Suits are represented in the
following manner:

H: Heart
S: Spade
D: Diamond
C: Club

Letters are either the letter or #
that are shown on a card apart from
the suit: A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10, J, K, and Q.

Values correspond to the letter of
a card. In the same order as shown
above each card is worth the
following: 11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 
8, 9, 10, 10, 10, and 10
respectively.

Additionally, the dealers second
card is set face down on the
table. This is symbolized within
the game as 'FD'.

**********************************
*Visualizing the game ************
**********************************

At the start of the match, you 
will be dealt 2 cards for your
starting hand. The same will be
true for the dealer. The dealers
second card will be set face down.

You will be asked to 'Hit', which
means adding another card to your
hand. You will also have the
option to 'Stand', which
corresponds to ending your turn.
The dealer will then proceed to
add cards to their hand.

If you, as a player, exceed 21
as your total score you
automatically lose the game. If
you decided to 'Stand' and the
dealers score was less than your
own, you win the game! If you
decided to 'Stand' and the
dealers score ended up being
higher than yours, then you lose
the game.
